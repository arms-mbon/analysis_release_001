These are the PEMA parameter files for this first processing batch that was run on the ARMS-MBON sequences, for the samples collected between 2018 and 2020 (all events that started in 2018 and 2019), for the COI, 18S, and ITS marker genes. 
In these parameter files are all the parameters that were set in PEMA. Note that 
* the date in the filenames refers to the date of the sequencing, rather than the sampling of the material
* for COI we used the the Midori v2 reference database

To learn more about all other parameters that were set, read the respective parameter files.
Note that the ENA run accession numbers of the sequences that were processed are not included in these parameter files: that information is contained in the
[PEMA COI batch1 overview](https://github.com/arms-mbon/analysis_release_001/blob/main/pema_overview_COI_batch1.xlsx), together with other relevant metadata. To know which of the parameter files listed here were used for any particular material sample / ENA sequence, you should also look at this overview file. 
For more information on PEMA and its parameters, see [the PEMA GitHub repo](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema).
