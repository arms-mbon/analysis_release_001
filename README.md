# analysis_release_001

These are the analysis results related to the publication XXX and as published in the EurOBIS DOI XXX (to be written once these references exist; give or refer to a list of stations and years that are covered)

The data here are the P.E.M.A bioinformatics analysis results of the subset of the sampling events taken from [ARMS GitHub working space](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace). This data workspace is where data are harvested from the source locations (PlutoF and google sheets for the event data; PEMA google drive for the taxonomic data), quality controlled, and combined into user-friendly formats. 

The sequence data arising from these sampling events were then processed with P.E.M.A. To see all the PEMA outputs, go to the [PEMA working repository](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/PEMAoutputs): here we include only the subset that are associated with the COI data from the 2018-2020 sampling events that are published in the [data_release repo](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_release_001).  

**MORE INFO on PEMA version etc? or explain the ro-crate here...**
